# Harmonization and Linkage of Swiss Open Government Data: Development of an R Package for Standardized Data Integration

## Abstract

This research addresses the critical challenge of data inconsistency within Swiss Open Government Data (OGD) repositories by developing a specialized R package, `odgharmonizR`. The package implements a systematic methodology for inspecting, harmonizing, and linking heterogeneous datasets from the opendata.swiss platform. Despite the existence of publishing standards, Swiss OGD exhibits considerable variance in formats, structures, and metadata conventions, primarily due to insufficient data governance frameworks across Swiss public sector organizations. This technical paper details the development, implementation, and preliminary evaluation of the package, which aims to enhance the accessibility and analytical utility of Swiss OGD.

## Introduction

Open Government Data initiatives represent a cornerstone of modern public sector transparency and innovation policies. In Switzerland, the opendata.swiss platform serves as the central repository for datasets from federal departments, cantons, and communes. While these datasets adhere to certain publication standards, they nevertheless exhibit significant heterogeneity in terms of file formats (e.g., XLSX, CSV, JSON), internal structures, naming conventions, date formats, and linguistic representationsâ€”reflecting Switzerland's multilingual context.

The absence of robust, cross-organizational data governance mechanisms in Swiss public institutions impedes the efficient management and interoperability of these datasets. This research addresses this gap through the development of an R package with specialized functions for automated inspection, harmonization, and linkage of datasets retrieved from opendata.swiss.

## Methodology

The development process followed standard R package development protocols utilizing the `devtools` framework and implemented test-driven development principles through the `testthat` package. Large Language Model (LLM) assistance, specifically Claude Sonnet 3.7 from Anthropic AI, was leveraged for code development, debugging, and environment structuring.

In the end, the package architecture should comprises three principal functional components:

1.  **Data Acquisition Module**: Interfaces with the opendata.swiss API to retrieve datasets based on user-specified parameters (random selection, categorical filtering, or direct URL specification). Notably, this implementation benefits from the API's open access policy, which does not require authentication.

2.  **Inspector Module**: Performs comprehensive examination of retrieved datasets to identify inconsistencies in structure, variable naming conventions, data types, and formatting standards. The module generates a structured JSON report documenting these inconsistencies for subsequent processing.

3.  **Harmonizer Module**: Applies standardization operations based on the inspector's JSON report, implementing consistent formatting for temporal data, standardized variable naming conventions, and uniform data typing across datasets.

4.  **Linkage Module**: Establishes relationships between harmonized datasets based on common identifiers or variables, enabling integrated analysis across previously disparate data sources.

## Current Development Status (as of April 18, 2025)

At present, development efforts are focused on debugging the API interface module. Specifically, the function's capacity to handle larger dataset volumes has introduced unexpected behavior when the default retrieval parameter was increased from 10 to 50 datasets. This issue represents a critical scalability consideration for practical application scenarios.

The testing framework, constructed using the `testthat` package, has successfully validated the core functionality of existing modules under controlled conditions. The package's directory structure adheres to R package development conventions, with the codebase hosted in a GitHub repository under the name "odgharmonizR". At the moment the package can be called locally via the devtools functions but is not publicly published yet.

There are still some tests that will have to be done like end-to-end manual testing.

## Technical Implementation Details

The package implements a modular approach to data harmonization:

```         
# Simplified representation of core package workflow
retrieve_datasets <- function(n = 50, category = NULL, url = NULL) {
  # API interaction logic to retrieve datasets based on parameters
  # Returns list of datasets with metadata
}

inspect_datasets <- function(datasets) {
  # Examination logic to identify inconsistencies
  # Returns JSON report of findings
}

harmonize_datasets <- function(datasets, inspection_report) {
  # Standardization logic based on inspection findings
  # Returns harmonized datasets
}

link_datasets <- function(harmonized_datasets, link_variables) {
  # Integration logic to establish relationships
  # Returns linked dataset
}
```

The inspector module implements heuristic algorithms to detect common inconsistencies, including:

-   Variant date formats (DD.MM.YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD, etc.)

-   Inconsistent variable naming conventions

-   Multilingual column headers (German, French, Italian)

-   Type inconsistencies (numeric values stored as text)

-   Missing value representations

## Possible Practical Applications

The `odgharmonizR` package addresses critical data integration challenges for researchers, policy analysts, and public sector data scientists working with Swiss OGD. By automating the harmonization process, the package significantly reduces the preprocessing overhead traditionally associated with cross-dataset analysis of public sector data.

Potential application domains include:

-   Longitudinal policy impact assessments

-   Cross-cantonal comparative analyses

-   Integrated public service performance monitoring

-   Evidence-based policy development

## Possible Future Development Directions

Planned enhancements include:

-   Implementation of advanced entity resolution algorithms for improved dataset linkage

-   Integration of multilingual lexical resources for automated semantic mapping

-   Development of interactive visualization components for harmonization outcomes

-   Expansion of test coverage to ensure robustness across diverse dataset characteristics

## Conclusion

The `odgharmonizR` package could represent a contribution to the technical infrastructure supporting Swiss Open Government Data utilization. By addressing fundamental harmonization challenges, this tool could enhance the analytical accessibility of public sector data and supports evidence-based governance initiatives. Further development and community engagement will be essential to maximize the package's utility across diverse application contexts.
