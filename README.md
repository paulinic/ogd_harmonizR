# Open Government Data inspection, harmonization and linking
Capstone project in the data mining with R course at University of Lucerne, spring 2025

## Idea
In Switzerland we have an extensive pool of Open Government Datasets which is even more growing since the "open by default" clause has been wirtten into law for any software that is being programmed for the swiss parliment.
